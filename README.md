# Just Move
Just Move is the first game i made. The game is very simple becasue I am still learning how to code games. In the game, you only need to move to collect carrots or cherrys. When your score is full, you can move the next secene. Be careful to avoid the weapons!

Note: Unity2D version is 2022.3.7f1
